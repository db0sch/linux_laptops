A list of linux friendly laptops

![boromir_meme](https://i.imgflip.com/18xlvc.jpg)

## important rules 
- try to avoid consumer laptops. they might carry some bios/uefi restrictions which prevent installing linux on these machines. professional series laptops are more suitable (but might be more expensive)
- avoid touch screen:
  1. linux UI not very touch compatible
  2. might create issues
- avoid Nvidia graphics card: always prefer intel graphic cards as they provide open source drivers. Nvidia can cause issues which are difficult to debug. The situation might be better now though (with the `nouveau` drivers). I invite you to check the best linux compatible nvidia cards on the web (more info here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA) 

## brands

### DELL

The XPS series:
- XPS 13 | [Dell website](http://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/xps-13/spd/xps-13-9360-laptop)
- XPS 13 Developper Edition | [Dell website](http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/xps-13-linux)
  // The developper edition comes with Ubuntu linux pre-installed (no windows though)

The Latitude series:
- 5000 and 7000 models | [Dell website](http://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/sf/latitude-laptops)

### LENOVO

Avoid consumer laptops from Lenovo at all cost. For two reasons:
- They ship consumer laptops infected with adware / spyware
- They sometimes add some restrictions to avoid linux installation

Go with the thinkpad models: http://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/think/
as they are known for the compatibility with linux (many sys admin use thinkpad on linux)

The X series: 
- X270 (and older version, until x220)
- X1 Carbon (quite expensive though)

The T series:
- T470 (and older version, such as T450)
- T470s (slim version)

### HP

According to HP, their laptops are compatible with Ubuntu -> [HP website](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/ubuntu/index.html)

I have no experience with installing linux on a HP computer. But then again, try to avoid consumer, and look at the pro models.

### System76

System76 is a linux installed computer manufacturer. It means their products will never ship with Microsoft Windows.
So if you want to keep Windows on the side (dual boot) for gaming or running any non cross platform apps (Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, ... etc), you'll should have a look at other manufacturers.

All their laptops are compatible with linux (at least ubuntu and derivatives), no wrong choices here.

### Asus

No experience in installing linux on Asus laptops.

### Acer

### Apple

Since the MacTel (Mac + intel) revolution, it is now possible to install Linux on Apple laptops.
But it seems that Apple made it more difficult on their 2017 models.

But models previous to 2016 should be Linux compatible. (not as seamless as Dell or Thinkpads, but should work).
